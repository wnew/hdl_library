Adder module readme
=============================

This module is an asyncronous adder and requires no reset or enable ports.

The adder module takes in 2 numbers, possibly with differing bit widths and
adds them together. The output bit width is set to the highest input bit width
+ 1. This effectively makes the highest bit of the output the carry bit. 

Due to the nature of fractional numbers the adder can handle addition of 
fractions, the designer is responsible for keeping track of the decimal point.

There is possible bit growth of a single when doing addition, the max output
will only be one bit longer then the longest input.
