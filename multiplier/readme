Multiplier module readme
=============================

This module is an asyncronous multiplier and requires no reset or enable ports.

The adder module takes in 2 numbers, possibly with differing bit widths and
multipliers them together. The output bit width is set to the sum of the input
bit widths.. 

Due to the nature of fractional numbers the multiplier can handle fixed point
arithmetic, the designer is responsible for keeping track of the decimal point.

There is possible bit growth of the sum of the lengths of the factors. For
fixed point arithmetic the multiplier will add the total number of bits from
each argument before and after the point. So if you had a multiplier with 8.5
bits on one input and 3.7 bits on another input you should have 11.12 bits on
the output.
